# Path_Planning
Planning the path of an autonomous car on a simulator.


## Goal
The goal of my project is to use the sensor fusion data to generate a safe and viable path for the vehicle to follow on a highway road. The vehicle must be able to:
* Stay in the same lane.
* Follow a smooth trajectory along the road.
* Change Lanes on a highway.
* Not excced the maximum speed limit.
* Not excced the maximuma acceleration limit.
* Not exceed the maximum jerk limit.
* Travel at least 4.32 miles without colliding with other vehicles on the highway.
* Stay in the fastest Lane to reach its goal in the least amount of time.
* Incorporate safety as well as efficiency into the vehicle.
